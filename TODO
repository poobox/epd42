* add embedded regression tests for drawing from progmem framebuffer, and other epd APIs

* Design a vector library similar to paint, which doesn't keep a full frame-buffer
** come up with a good resonable algorithm for rasterizing in small chunks
*** probably just 2d clipping algorithms

* figure out native unit tests and selecting which tests run in platform.ini

* Clean up constant usage throughout libraries. try to make pstr_helper and test_helper
more user friendly.

* memory usage.
** do some actualy profiling to see how close we are to 2K
** test on new adafruit clone with more RAM
